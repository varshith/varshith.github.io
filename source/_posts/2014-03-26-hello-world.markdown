Hello World.

VinuVarshith here. I love *open source*. I am currently working with **Drupal** and loving every bit of it. I also worked with *Hadoop, HBase, Nutch, Solr, Redis* etc.

Along the way I've had blocks to which finding the way around was not straightforward. Many times I searched for a solution and couldn't find it anywhere and I had to find it out the hard way.

I always wanted to start a blog and let people know how to solve such problems, tips and tricks to make life better etc.

I hope this would be a small contribution to the world of open source.

You can learn [more about me here](/about).
